# ShellFish
While abstract mathematics may be useful for exploring theoretical implications
of even more theoretical conditions, a down-to-earth experiment is necessary to
bring some clarity into view. ShellFish is a Selfish Mining Simulator written in
JavaScript for the better judgement of Bitcoin's (Bitcoin Cash) Proof-of-Work
based security model. Its main feature is to simulate the aspect of luck in the
mining process as closely as possible. For that reason, ShellFish also includes
a custom difficulty adjustment algorithm in its implementation.

This software was made out of scientific curiosity rather than a political bias.
As a result, the author of this simulator has been convinced that Selfish Mining
is a non-issue and has no real-world uses. However, enhancemnts (pull requests)
from third parties are still welcome because a lot is yet to be improved in the
preciseness of this simulator.
